    ** The Olympic Games that we enjoy so much today actually trace back over a couple thousand years, and have a deep and rich history. Legends actually trace  Olympic Games to about 776 BC, although there are many differing opinions about when the Games actually began. Early on, the Olympic games were actually more than just a time to show off physical prowess, but they were also a time when people of Greece gave a variety of sacrifices to their mythical gods, including the god Zeus. As Olympic Games began to grow and there were many more games added to be played, the time period of games lengthened as well, and soon became an event that lasted for 4 consecutive days.
  <br><br>
** For awhile, when the Romans came to power and Christianity deemed the games to be sacrilegious,the games almost came to a stop, but in the 1800â€™s there began to be a revival of the Olympic Games. It was actually in Paris, in 1894 that it was finally decided that the Olympic Games would officially begin to take place again, with them starting out in the place of their original origin - Athens. In 1896, the first games took place and was then the largest sporting event ever held on an international level. With almost 250 athletes participating in these games, they quickly became popular around world, it was decided that the games would be held again, four years later, as the traditional games had been held. The second games were then held 4 years later in Paris, France, and became even more popular.
 <br><br>
  ** Today the Olympic Games have become one of the biggest sporting highlights across the world, with 203 countries participating in games. These games bring the people of various countries together in a way that nothing else has been able to do, with even more countries participating in  Games than in  UN. Today Olympic Games are going strong and a record turnout is predicted for the 2008 Olympic Games.
